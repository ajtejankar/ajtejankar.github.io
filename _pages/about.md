I am a 2nd year PhD student at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu). My advisor is [Dr. Hamed Pirsiavash](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hpirsiav/).

__Research__: I primarily work on self-supervised learning for images. My focus thus far has been improving the quality of features learnt by self-supervised models. This has involved using knowledge distillation for improving smaller models and improving the loss functions for better semantic level grouping. Recently, I have become interested in analyzing the failure modes of these methods. Specifically, how changing the input dataset affects the representations of the final model? I am also interesting in vision-language pre-training.

__Previously__: I obtained my MS in Computer Science from [UMBC](https://umbc.edu) in 2020. I am currently interning at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com) where I also interned during Summer 2021. I interned at [Matroid](https://www.matroid.com) in Summer 2020.
